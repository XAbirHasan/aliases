## How to Use:

1. **Modify `MIMIR_PATH` in `.bash_aliases` file:**
   - Open `.bash_aliases` in your preferred text editor.
   - Locate and modify the `MIMIR_PATH` variable to point to your desired Mimir installation path.

2. **Copy the `.bash_aliases` file to your user root where `.bashrc` is located:**
   - Ensure that the `.bash_aliases` file is placed in your user root directory alongside the `.bashrc` file.

3. **Enjoy:**
   - Close any open terminal sessions and reopen them to activate the changes.
   - Your custom shortcuts and aliases will be available for use in the terminal sessions.

Please note that if you have any terminal sessions open while making these changes, they need to be closed and reopened to ensure the aliases take effect.
